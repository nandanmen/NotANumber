# Paths Are Made Of Commands

The weird string that you see in the `d` attribute of SVG paths is actually a series of commands:

```
M 20 20
v 20
m 30 0
v -20
M 10 50
Q 40 70 65 50
```

All path commands follow the same format:

- A **letter code** indicating the command type, and;
- A series of **numbers** indicating the command's parameters.

The letter can be uppercase or lowercase, with a lowercase letter indicating the command uses _relative_ coordinates.

For example, you can think of the `M 20 20` command as a function call that looks like this:

```js
M({ x: 20, y: 20, relative: false });
```

Commands are grouped into three different types:

**Cursor commands**, which move the path's internal cursor without drawing a line or a curve;

```
M 20 20
m 30 0
M 10 50
```

---

**Line commands**, which draw a straight line from the cursor's current position to another position;

```
v 20
v -20
```

---

And **curve commands**, which draw a curve from the cursor's current position to another position, using control points to determine its "curvy"-ness.

```
Q 40 70 65 50
```

Of course, this is by no means an exhaustive list. There are many more commands than the ones you see here. Let's take a look at them, shall we?
