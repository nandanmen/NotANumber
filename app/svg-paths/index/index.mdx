If you're anything like me, you might've glossed over this attribute in the past, assuming they're nothing more than the output of your designer's favorite vector graphics editor.

While, er, that may be true, it's also a _bit_ of an oversimplification.

You see, understanding this attribute's inner workings ended up being a huge boon to my front-end skills; it allowed me to do things I never thought possible, like making this bendy square animation:

<SquareToggle />

<Svg width="100%">
  <Square />
</Svg>

This guide is an interactive deep dive into the `d` attribute, otherwise known as the **path data**. It's the post I wish I had when I first learned about SVG paths! Along the way, we'll learn about the different types of path commands and how to use them to draw various icons.

Let's get started!

## A Path is a Series of Commands

While the `d` attribute may look like some magical incantation, it's actually a **series of commands** that tell the browser how the path should be drawn. This is a bit more obvious if we clean up the `d` attribute a little bit:

<CommandSlider />

<CommandListFromSource source="commands" />

<Svg>
  <Commands />
</Svg>

To draw the path, the browser executes these commands sequentially, each command drawing a little "subsection" of the path.

You see, all path commands follow the same basic syntax:

- A **letter code** indicating the command type, and;
- A series of **numbers** indicating the command's parameters.

In some ways, you can think of them as a function call, where the letter code is the function name and the numbers are the function's arguments:

```js
M({ x: 20, y: 20, relative: false });
```

Commands are grouped into three different types:

---

**Cursor commands**, which move the path's _internal cursor_ without drawing a line or a curve;

```
M 20 20
m 30 0
M 10 50
```

---

**Line commands**, which draw a straight line from the cursor's current position to another position;

```
v 20
v -20
```

---

And **curve commands**, which draw a curve from the cursor's current position to another position, using control points to determine its "curvy"-ness.

```
Q 40 70 65 50
```

---

Of course, this is by no means an exhaustive list. There are many more commands than the ones you see here. Let's take a look at them, shall we?
