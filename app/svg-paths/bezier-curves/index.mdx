# Curves I: Bezier Curves

Let's be honest. You wouldn't be reaching for SVG paths if you only wanted to draw straight lines; you'd use an SVG `<line />` element instead.

The true power of SVG paths comes from being able to draw curves. So let's talk about curve commands! There are three types of curves you can draw using SVG paths: **quadratic bezier curves**, **cubic bezier curves**, and **arcs**.

We'll divide these conversations into three parts, starting with quadratic bezier curves first.

## Bezier Curves

A bezier curve is a curve that is defined by a series of points known as **control points**. SVG paths support two types of bezier curves — **quadratic** bezier curves, which have one control point, and **cubic** bezier curves, which have two control points.

**The more control points a curve has, the more complex the curve can be.** Try moving the points in the playground and notice that the cubic bezier curve (the bottom curve) has a lot more freedom in its shape when compared to the quadratic curve (the top curve).

## Quadratic Curves

While cubic bezier curves are more flexible, quadratic bezier curves are simpler to write, making them preferable when you don't need the extra shape.

The `Q` command lets you draw a quadratic bezier curve:

```
Q controlX controlY endX endY
```

This curve, for example, creates a rounded corner:

  <RoundedCorner />
</Svg>

## Chaining Quadratic Curves

If you want to write multiple, consecutive quadratic curves, you might be tempted to write something like this:

```
Q 5 10 10 10
Q 15 10 15 15
```

While this works just fine, there _is_ an easier way — **using the `T` command**:

<CommandListFromSource source="chain" />

The `T` command will draw a new quadratic curve using the _reflection_ of the previous curve's control point. Try changing the control point of the first curve and notice how it changes the second curve.

> Of course, this approach will only work if the reflection point is indeed the point that you're looking for - if it's not, you'll still have to use the full `Q` command.
