# Paths Are Made Of Commands

The weird string that you see in the `d` attribute of SVG paths is actually a series of commands:

```
M 20 20
v 20
m 30 0
v -20
M 10 50
Q 40 70 65 50
```

As you might be able to tell, each command essentially follows the same format:

1. A **letter** that identifies the type of the command, and;
2. A **sequence of numbers** that represents the arguments passed to the command.

Commands are grouped into three different types:

### Cursor Commands

These commands move the path's internal cursor, letting you create different path segments.

```
M 20 20
m 30 0
M 10 50
```

---

### Line Commands

These commands draw lines from the current cursor position to a new position.

```
v 20
v -20
```

---

### Curve Commands

These commands draw various curves from the current cursor position to a new position.

```
Q 40 70 65 50
```

---

Of course, this is by no means an exhaustive list. There are many more commands than the ones you see here. Let's take a look at them, shall we?
