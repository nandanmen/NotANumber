# Challenge

And that's all I have to say about SVG paths! To summarize, SVG paths are constructed with a series of path commands, each of which is followed by a series of coordinates. Path commands are grouped into three categories:

- **Move commands**, which move the path's cursor to a new location without drawing anything;
- **Line commands**, which draw straight lines from the cursor's current position to a new location, and;
- **Curve commands**, which draw various types of curves starting from the cursor's current position.

## Animations

One thing I didn't touch on in this guide is how to _animate_ paths. I initially had animations in the first draft of the guide, but as I started writing it, I realized there was a _lot_ to cover.

In the end, I decided to split off animations into a course called [Interactive SVG Animations](https://svg-animations.how). If you enjoyed the teaching style of this guide, consider checking it out!

## Challenges

The rest of this guide will be a leetcode-esque series of challenges - tracing over eight beautiful icons courtesy of [Iconist's Central icon system](https://iconists.co/central). Massive kudos to them for allowing me to use their icons in this guide!
