# Arcs

The arc, or `A` command, is the last of the SVG path commands we'll be looking at and, in my opinion, the least intuitive to use.

The arc command lets you draw a **section of an ellipse** using the following (admittedly confusing) syntax:

```
A rx ry rotation large-arc-flag sweep-flag x y
```

As an example, the arc that you see here is drawn using the following commands:

<CommandListFromSource source="syntax" />

We'll dive into what each of these values means in a moment, but first, try to change the controls in the sandbox to get a feel for how the arc command works.

## How Arcs Are Formed

**An arc is a portion of an ellipse.**

You use the `rx` and `ry` values to control the ellipse's size, and the `x` and `y` values to control where the arc ends on the canvas.

---

The arc command works by taking the following values:

- The initial cursor position;
- The `rx` and `ry` values;
- The `x` and `y` values;

And then finding an ellipse that "matches" the given values — that is, an ellipse with both of the arc's points on its circumference and with radius `rx` and `ry`.

**Try changing the radius of the arc or the position of the endpoint in the sandbox**. Notice that the ellipse will change to always fit the two points and the provided radii.

---

What happens when there _isn't_ a match?

We can make that happen by making the diameter smaller than the distance between the arc's points. **Try reducing the `rx` value to anything less than ten** and see what happens.

Notice that when the ellipse isn't big enough to fit the arc's points, the arc isn't affected — it still follows the ellipse's curve. This suggests that the ellipse is implicitly _scaled_ to fit the arc!

---

## X-Axis Rotation

Let's look at the next argument, `x-axis-rotation`. As you might expect, this value rotates the ellipse around its x (or horizontal) axis.

**Try changing the third argument of the arc command and notice how the ellipse rotates around.**

## Large Arc and Sweep Flags

For any given pair of points, there are actually _four_ arcs that can be drawn between them. The `large-arc` and `sweep` flags control which of these four arcs are drawn.

Try toggling the flags here and try to see if you can figure out what each of the flags means:

---

Did you catch it? Let's dig into this.

Out of the four arcs that can be drawn between two points, two of the arcs are drawn _clockwise_ while the other two are drawn _counterclockwise_. **The `sweep` flag controls the direction the arc is drawn, with `0` meaning counterclockwise.**

---

Once you've picked a direction, there are still two arcs left — one that's smaller than a semicircle, and one that's larger. **The `large-arc` flag controls which of these arcs is drawn, with `0` meaning the smaller arc.**

---

In short:

- `sweep` controls the direction of the arc, with `0` meaning the arc is drawn counterclockwise;
- `large-arc` controls the size of the chosen arc, with `0` meaning the smaller arc is picked.

---

## Summary

Here's the arc command in its entirety:

- The arc is a portion of an ellipse;
- The arc is drawn from the current cursor position to the `x` and `y` values;
- The `rx` and `ry` values control the size of the ellipse;
- The `x-axis-rotation` value rotates the ellipse around its x-axis;
- The `large-arc-flag` and `sweep-flag` values control which of the four possible arcs are drawn.

You can play around with the different fields in the sandbox to get a better feel of how they change the shape of the arc.

## Practice

Using _both_ curve commands and the other commands we've seen, trace over this rainy cloud:

```
M 10 20
c -10 -1 -10 -14 0 -15
q 6 -1 8 5
c 7 0 7 10 0 10
m -1.0 -2
v 6
m -2.0 -4.5
v 6
m -2.0 -6
v 6
m -2.0 -7.5
v 6
```
