# Animating Paths

We'll finish off by talking about how to animate SVG paths. In my opinion, we can categorize SVG animations into three types:

- Animating path _length_;
- _Morphing_ a path into another path;
- Animating _along_ a path.

Let's take a look at how you might implement all three kinds using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Animating Path Length

## Morphing Paths

## Animating Along a Path
