# Lines

Now that we know all about cursors, let's start drawing stuff.

We've seen a bit of line commands in the last section, but we'll cover them in full here. As you might expect, the line commands let you draw **straight lines**.

The most generic of them is the `L` command, which draws a line to a specific `(x, y)` coordinate:

```
L 10 20
```

---

Just like how the `m` command moves the cursor relative to its current position, the lowercase `l` command draws a line relative to the current cursor position:

```
L 10 20
l 10 -7.5
```

---

If you'd just like to draw a line in a specific direction, you can use the `H` and `V` commands. `H` draws a horizontal line, and `V` draws a vertical line:

```
L 10 20
H 30
V 10
```

---

Like the other commands, `H` and `V` also come with lowercase versions that use relative coordinates:

```
L 10 20
h 20
v -10
```

_(This will be the last time I explicitly mention the lowercase relative version of the commands. For the rest of this guide, assume that all commands have a relative variant!)_

## Practice

Trace over this house using all of the commands we've seen so far (including the cursor commands from the last section):
