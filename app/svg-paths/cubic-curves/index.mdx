# Curves II: Cubic Curves

Quadratic curves are great, but as we saw in the previous section, they can be pretty limiting — there are only so many shapes you can make with only one control point!

This pill shape, for example, doesn't look quite right using quadratic curves:

<CommandHighlight
  commands={["M 5 5", "h 5", "q 5 2.5 0 5", "h -5", "q -5 -2.5 0 -5", "z"]}
  indices={[2, 4]}
/>

---

But if we change the quadratic curves to cubic curves instead, we get a much smoother pill shape:

<CommandHighlight
  commands={["M 5 5", "h 5", "c 4 0 4 5 0 5", "h -5", "c -4 0 -4 -5 0 -5", "z"]}
  indices={[2, 4]}
/>

We were able to make the curve look better because we had an extra control point to work with.

## Syntax

We saw the cubic curve syntax just now but here it is more formally. To draw a cubic curve, we use the `C` command:

```
C x1 y1 x2 y2 x y
```

For example:

Notice that the command looks just like the quadratic curve command but with an extra pair of coordinates for the second control point.

---

You can kind of think of the cubic curve as a "generalization" of the quadratic curve — every quadratic curve can be represented as a cubic curve by putting the control points in the right place.

**Try moving the control points in the sandbox so the bezier curve lines up with the quadratic curve behind it.**

> Interestingly, the point where the two curves line up is _not_ when the two control points are in the same place!

## Multiple Bezier Curves

Just like how quadratic curves can use the `T` command to chain two quadratic curves together, cubic curves can use the `S` command to chain two cubic curves together.

The syntax, as you might expect, is the same as the `T` command but with an extra pair of coordinates for the second control point:

```
S x2 y2 x y
```

Here, we use the `S` command to create a hot air balloon shape:
