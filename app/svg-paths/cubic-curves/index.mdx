# Curves II: Cubic Curves

Quadratic curves are great, but as we saw in the previous section, they can be pretty limiting â€” there are only so many shapes you can make with only one control point!

This pill shape, for example, doesn't look quite right using quadratic curves:

<CommandList
  id="pill"
  commands="M 5 5
    h 5 
    q 5 2.5 0 5 
    h -5
    q -5 -2.5 0 -5
    z
  "
/>

---

Now if we change to use **cubic** curves which have **two** control points, we get a much nicer-looking pill shape:

<CommandList
  id="pill-corrected"
  commands="M 5 5
    h 5
    c 4 0 4 5 0 5
    h -5
    c -4 0 -4 -5 0 -5
    z
  "
/>

## Syntax

We saw the cubic curve syntax just now, but here it is more explicitly:

```
C x1 y1, x2 y2, x y
```

The command looks just like the quadratic curve command but with an extra pair of coordinates for the second control point.

As another example, here we use cubic curves to draw a little trophy icon:

## Multiple Bezier Curves

Just like with quadratic curves, you can create a cubic curve that depends on the previous curve using the `S` command:

```
C 10 25 20 5 25 15
S 40 5 45 15
```

## Practice

Using _both_ curve commands and the other commands we've seen, trace over this rainy cloud:

```
M 10 20
c -10 -1 -10 -14 0 -15
q 6 -1 8 5
c 7 0 7 10 0 10
m -1.0 -2
v 6
m -2.0 -4.5
v 6
m -2.0 -6
v 6
m -2.0 -7.5
v 6
```
