# Curves II: Cubic Curves

Quadratic curves are great, but only having one control point can be limiting. For example, you can't really make a nice-looking pill shape using quadratic curves.

---

On the other hand, cubic curves, the second type of SVG path curve, have **two control points**. This gives you a lot more flexibility in how you can shape your curves.

---

Two control points mean you can bend your curve in two different directions. Like maybe to make a little trophy?

## Syntax

Making a cubic bezier curve is very similar to making a quadratic curve, but with the addition of one extra control point (which means an extra pair of `(x,y)` coordinates):

```
C x1 y1, x2 y2, x y
```

Like all the other commands, you can use the lowercase `c` to make all the coordinates relative to the cursor.

```
c dx1 dy1, dx2 dy2, dx dy
```

---

## Multiple Bezier Curves

Just like with quadratic curves, you can create a cubic curve that depends on the previous curve using the `S` command:

```
C 10 25 20 5 25 15
S 40 5 45 15
```

## Practice

Using _both_ curve commands and the other commands we've seen, trace over this rainy cloud:

```
M 10 20
c -10 -1 -10 -14 0 -15
q 6 -1 8 5
c 7 0 7 10 0 10
m -1.0 -2
v 6
m -2.0 -4.5
v 6
m -2.0 -6
v 6
m -2.0 -7.5
v 6
```
