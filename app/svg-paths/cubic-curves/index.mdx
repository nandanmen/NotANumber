# Curves II: Cubic Curves

Quadratic curves are great, but as we saw in the previous section, they can be pretty limiting — there are only so many shapes you can make with only one control point!

This pill shape, for example, doesn't look quite right using quadratic curves:

<CommandHighlight
  commands={["M 5 5", "h 5", "q 5 2.5 0 5", "h -5", "q -5 -2.5 0 -5", "z"]}
  indices={[2, 4]}
/>

---

But if we change the quadratic curves to cubic curves instead, we get a much smoother pill shape:

<CommandHighlight
  commands={["M 5 5", "h 5", "c 4 0 4 5 0 5", "h -5", "c -4 0 -4 -5 0 -5", "z"]}
  indices={[2, 4]}
/>

We were able to make the curve look better because we had an extra control point to work with.

## Syntax

To draw a cubic curve, we use the `C` command:

```
C x1 y1 x2 y2 x y
```

The command looks just like the quadratic curve command but with an extra pair of coordinates for the second control point.

As another example, here we use cubic curves to draw a hot air balloon:

<CommandHighlight
  commands={[
    "M 6 10",
    "c 0 -2 -2 -2 -2 -5",
    "c 0 -5 7 -5 7 0",
    "c 0 3 -2 3 -2 5",
    "h -3",
    "m 0.25 0",
    "v 1.5",
    "h -0.25",
    "v 1",
    "q 0 1 1 1",
    "h 1",
    "q 1 0 1 -1",
    "v -1",
    "h -3",
    "m 2.75 0",
    "v -1.5",
  ]}
  indices={[1, 2, 3]}
  collapseAfter={5}
/>

## Multiple Bezier Curves

Just like with quadratic curves, you can create a cubic curve that depends on the previous curve using the `S` command:

```
C 10 25 20 5 25 15
S 40 5 45 15
```

## Practice

Using _both_ curve commands and the other commands we've seen, trace over this rainy cloud:

<PathEditor id="practice" />

```
M 10 20
c -10 -1 -10 -14 0 -15
q 6 -1 8 5
c 7 0 7 10 0 10
m -1.0 -2
v 6
m -2.0 -4.5
v 6
m -2.0 -6
v 6
m -2.0 -7.5
v 6
```
