# Cursors

At the heart of all SVG paths is the **cursor**. All path commands _use_ the cursor to determine where to start drawing from, and all path commands _move_ the cursor to ensure the following command starts from the correct position.

Consider this little corner, defined with the following commands:

<CommandListFromSource source="corner" />

Initially, the cursor is at the top left corner, the origin point `(0, 0)`. Then, the three commands change the cursor as follows:

- `M 5 5` moves the cursor to `(5, 5)`;
- `v 5` draws a vertical line of length 5, moving the cursor to `(5, 10)`;
- `L 10 15` draws a line to `(10, 15)`, moving the cursor to `(10, 15)`;
- `h 5` draws a horizontal line of length 5, moving the cursor to `(15, 15)`.

Generally speaking, the cursor will end up wherever the current path "section" finishes. This makes sense because, most of the time, you want your path sections to be connected to one another.

By checking if the command is **absolute** or **relative**, we can determine how the cursor will be moved after the command is executed:

For **absolute commands**, the cursor will end up at the command's `x` and `y` values. For example, `L 10 15` will move the cursor to `(10, 15)` _regardless_ of where the cursor is currently at.

<InteractiveCommand
  id="absolute"
  template={({ x, y }) => `M ${x.toFixed(1)} ${y.toFixed(1)} L 10 15`}
/>

For **relative commands**, the cursor will end up at the cursor's current position _plus_ the command's `dx` and `dy` values. For example, if the cursor is currently at `(15, 5)`, then `l 10 15` will move the cursor to `(25, 20)`.

<InteractiveCommand
  template={({ x, y }) => `M ${x.toFixed(1)} ${y.toFixed(1)} l 10 15`}
  id="relative"
/>

Remember: commands written with an uppercase letter are **absolute** commands, while commands written with a lowercase letter are **relative** commands.

## Move Command

There is a special command that _only_ moves the cursor without drawing anything. This command is called the **move command** and is denoted with the `M` (or `m`) code:

```
M <x> <y>
m <dx> <dy>
```

These are useful when you want to draw paths that aren't connected to one another:

## Practice

Using the `M` and/or `m` commands, **move the cursor to the points shown on the canvas**.
