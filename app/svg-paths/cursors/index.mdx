# Cursors

At the heart of all SVG paths is the **cursor**. All path commands _use_ the cursor to determine where to start drawing from, and all path commands _move_ the cursor to ensure the following command starts from the correct position.

---

Consider this little corner, defined with the following commands:

<CommandList
  id="command-list-corner"
  commands="
    M 10 10
    L 20 10
    v 10
  "
/>

The cursor always starts at the top left corner, the origin point `(0, 0)`. Then, the three commands change the cursor as follows:

- `M 10 10` moves the cursor to `(10, 10)`.
- `L 20 10` draws a line from `(10, 10)` to `(20, 10)`, and moves the cursor to `(20, 10)`.
- `v 10` draws a line from `(20, 10)` to `(20, 20)`, and moves the cursor to `(20, 20)`.

---

By checking if the command is **absolute** or **relative**, we can determine how the cursor will be moved after the command is executed:

For **absolute commands**, the cursor will end up at the command's `x` and `y` values. For example, `L 10 15` will move the cursor to `(10, 15)` _regardless_ of where the cursor is currently at.

<InteractiveCommand
  id="absolute"
  template={({ x, y }) => `M ${x.toFixed(1)} ${y.toFixed(1)} L 10 15`}
/>

For **relative commands**, the cursor will end up at the cursor's current position _plus_ the command's `dx` and `dy` values. For example, if the cursor is currently at `(15, 5)`, then `l 10 15` will move the cursor to `(25, 20)`.

<InteractiveCommand
  template={({ x, y }) => `M ${x.toFixed(1)} ${y.toFixed(1)} l 10 15`}
  id="relative"
/>

Remember: commands written with an uppercase letter are **absolute** commands, while commands written with a lowercase letter are **relative** commands.

## Move Command

There is a special command that _only_ moves the cursor without drawing anything. This command is called the **move command** and is denoted with the `M` (or `m`) code:

```
M <x> <y>
m <dx> <dy>
```

These are useful when you want to draw paths that aren't connected to one another:

<CommandList
  id="command-list-move"
  commands="
    M 5 8
    q 2 2 0 4
    m 3 -6
    q 4 4 0 8
    m 3 -10
    q 4 6 0 12
  "
/>

## Practice

Using the `M` and/or `m` commands, **move the cursor to the points shown on the canvas**.
