By far my favourite part about Framer Motion is its magical layout animations—slap on the `layout` prop to any motion component, and watch as that component seamlessly transition from one part of the page to the next:

<FullWidth>
  <TokenList type={["single-character"]} toggleable />
  <Caption>
    When you click on "Hide types", the squares seamlessly move from one
    position to the next.
  </Caption>
</FullWidth>

In this post, I want to dive deep into the techniques that allow these layout animations to happen. Specifically, we'll go over concepts like:

1. **FLIP**, the underlying technique that makes layout animations possible;
2. **Animating size** using FLIP and its relationship with position;
3. **Correcting distortions** by applying an inverse scale to all children of animating elements;

Let's get started!

## Introducing FLIP

FLIP, which stands for **F**irst, **L**ast, **I**nverse, **P**lay, is the underlying technique that powers Framer Motion's layout animations. It allows you to emulate changes in "slow" layout properties like `width` and even animate "un-animatable" CSS properties like `justify-content`. Here's how it works.

In the following examples, we'll use FLIP to animate this change in `justify-content` from `flex-start` to `flex-end`:

<FlipExample />

### First

**First**. Before we do the layout change, we record the initial position of the element in terms of `x` and `y` coordinates:

<FlipFirst />

We can do this in code by using a `ref` and the `getBoundingClientRect(){:js}` method:

```tsx {1,5}
const Motion = (props) => {
  const ref = React.useRef();

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const { x, y } = ref.current.getBoundingClientRect();
  }, []);

  return <div ref={ref} {...props} />;
};
```

### Last

**Last**. Then we trigger the layout change and record the position of the square again:

<FlipLast />

To get this working in code, we'll first assume that **a layout change means the component just re-rendered**. So let's start by removing the dependency array from the `useEffect` hook to make the hook run every render.

Try triggering the layout change a few times and check the console to see what `x` and `y` values show up:

<FlipLastReact />

Pop quiz time!

<Quiz label="box-position" answer="final">

<Quiz.Question>
  **After the layout change**, is `box` in the snippet above referring to the
  **initial** position or the **final** position of the square?
</Quiz.Question>

<Quiz.Options>

<Quiz.Option label="initial">
  
The `initial` position

</Quiz.Option>

<Quiz.Option label="final">
  
The `final` position

</Quiz.Option>

</Quiz.Options>

<Quiz.Tip htmlFor="initial">
  Not quite! Because effects run after the component renders, the box is
  actually referring to the square's final position.
</Quiz.Tip>
<Quiz.Tip htmlFor="final">
  That's right! Because effects run after the component renders, the box is
  referring to the square's final position.
</Quiz.Tip>

</Quiz>

If you answered <Quiz.Spoiler htmlFor="box-position">the final position</Quiz.Spoiler>, you'd be right!

This is because **the `useEffect` hook runs after the component renders**. So when we call `getBoundingClientRect(){:js}` in the `useEffect` hook, we're actually getting the position of the square <Quiz.Spoiler htmlFor="box-position">after</Quiz.Spoiler> the layout change.

So how do you get the <Quiz.Spoiler htmlFor="box-position">initial</Quiz.Spoiler> position?

One way is to create a ref (using `useRef`) and store the previous value there every time you measure the box:

<InitialPositionSandbox />

### Inverse

In the **inverse** phase, we modify the position of the square so that it _looks_ like it didn't move at all. To do this, we compare the two measurements we made and calculate a transform that we then apply to the square:

<FlipInverse />

Here's a React implementation of the technique:

<InverseSandbox />

Notice that if you press toggle, nothing happens! This is because the square was transformed to look like it didn't move an inch.

### Play

So far, we have a square that has a transform applied to it to make it look like it didn't move after toggle is pressed.

In the final step of FLIP, the **Play** step, we animate this transform down to zero to make the square animate to its final position.

<FlipPlay />

There are various ways that you can implement this animation; I personally opted to use the `animate` function from [Popmotion](https://popmotion.io/#quick-start-animation-animate):

<PlaySandbox />

### Putting Everything Together

By doing all of the steps together, we get...

<FlipOverview />

Voila! Magical layout animations.

## Animating Size

So far we've only used FLIP to animate a change in _position_. Can we do the same thing but for _size_? Let's try to replicate the following animation where the square stretches to fill the whole container:

<SizeLayoutExample />

We won't mix changes in position and size together for now; we'll get to that in a bit.

### Measuring Size Changes

We'll start off by measuring the size of the square before and after the layout change. Thankfully, the `.getBoundingClientRect()` method we used to measure the square also happens to return the `width` and `height` of the element:

```ts
const { width, height } = squareRef.current.getBoundingClientRect();
```

<SizeMeasurements />

### Inverting Size Changes

To invert the size change, we'll divide the final size with the initial size:

```ts
const deltaWidth = box.width / initialBoxRef.current.width;
```

This gives us a number that we can pass to `scale`:

```ts
squareRef.current.style.transform = `scaleX(${deltaWidth})`;
```

<InverseSizeSlider />

And instead of animating the scale to zero like we did with position, we'll animate the scale to one (if we animate to zero instead, the element will disappear altogether):

```ts
animate({
  from: deltaWidth,
  to: 1,
  // ...
});
```

<SizePlayAnimation />

## Consolidating Size with Position

Cool! So far we're able to use FLIP to animate changes in position and size. What happens when we try to animate both size _and_ position?

<SizeDistanceExample />

Hmm, that looks a little off. What's going on here? If we pause the animation just before the play step, we can see that something went wrong in the inverse step - the square isn't quite lining up with its original position:

<SizeDistanceInverseSnapshot />

### Fixing Transform Origins

Let's try to figure this out.

When we combine changes in position and size, we're performing two separate transformations in the inverse step — a translation and a scale. If we take a look at those transformations individually, we can see how the square ended up where it did:

<SharedState initialState={170}>

<CorrectedInverseAnimation
  from={(width, container) => ({
    x: container.width - width - container.padding,
    y: container.height / 2 - width / 2,
  })}
  to={(width, container) => ({
    x: container.padding,
    y: container.height / 2 - width / 2,
  })}
/>

Our algorithm first lines up the top left point of the final position with the top left point of the original position, and then it scales it down to the initial size.

The scale transform seems to be the culprit here - it's scaling from the _center_ of the square, causing the square to end up in the wrong location. Now if we change the transform origin to the top left instead so that it lines up with the translation...

```ts
squareRef.current.style.transformOrigin = "top left";
```

<CorrectedInverseAnimation
  from={(width, container) => ({
    x: container.width - width - container.padding,
    y: container.height / 2 - width / 2,
  })}
  to={(width, container) => ({
    x: container.padding,
    y: container.height / 2 - width / 2,
  })}
  origin="topLeft"
/>

Would you look at that; it works!

### What if Transform Origins Change?

Of course, the big caveat with this solution is that we've hard coded in the transform origin value. What if the user wants a different transform origin? The layout animation should still work in this case.

The trick, it turns out, is to make sure the inverse step compares the distance between the _transform origins_ of the two squares. To put it another way, the bug is happening because of a discrepancy between the measured distance and the transform origins: `getBoundingClientRect()` returns the _top left_ point of the element whereas the transform origin is at the _center_ of the element by default.

The distance between the top left point and the distance between the centers are only equivalent when the two squares are the same size:

<SizeDistanceRelationship />

_I'm only comparing the horizontal distance here for simplicity - the same concept applies if we take into account the vertical distance too._

When the final square is larger, the distance between the centers is _larger_ than the distance between the top left points. Similarly, when the final square is smaller, the distance between the centers is _smaller_ than the distance between the top left points.

With this insight, we can also solve the bug by using the distance between the centers instead of the top left points:

<CorrectedInverseAnimation
  from={(width, container) => ({
    x: container.width - width / 2 - container.padding,
    y: container.height / 2,
  })}
  to={(width, container) => ({
    x: container.padding + width / 2,
    y: container.height / 2,
  })}
/>

</SharedState>

## Correcting Child Distortions

Great! So far, we're able to make a layout animation that can seamlessly transition changes in size and position. Now let's add another test - what happens if our element has **child elements**?

<SizeDistanceExample text="Hello!" corrected />

Oh no! The text appears to be changing size. How do we fix this?

The culprit here is once again the inverse scale transform. When we're inverting to a smaller square, the text ends up smaller because the square is scaled down. Similarly, when we're inverting to a larger square, the text ends up larger because the square is scaled up.

This leads us to our problem:

<ProblemStatement>
  How do we make sure all child elements stay a uniform size during FLIP?
</ProblemStatement>

### Inverse Scale Formula

One way is to apply _another_ transform on the child element that "cancels out" the parent's transform. One transform we can do is:

```
childScale = 1 / parentScale
```

The idea is if the parent gets twice as large, then the child needs to halve its size for it to stay the same size. Try moving the slider below and notice how the text stays the same size regardless of the size of the square:

<InverseScaleFormulaSandbox />

Great! Now how would we integrate this with our layout animations?

### First Attempt

The first thing that I tried was to calculate the inverse scale _once_, just before the parent is about to animate, and then running a separate animation on the child:

```ts
/* this runs in the child when the parent is about to animate */
const inverseTransform = {
  scaleX: 1 / parentTransform.scaleX,
  scaleY: 1 / parentTransform.scaleY,
};
play({
  from: inverseTransform,
  to: { scaleX: 1, scaleY: 1 },
});
```

For example, if the parent is animating from `scaleX: 2` to `scaleX: 1`, then the child will be animating from `scaleX: 1 / 2` to `scaleX: 1` using the same timing. My thinking was that as long as the timing of the scale correction is the same as the parent animation, this approach should work.

Except I was wrong, because this is what the approach produces:

<NaiveScaleCorrection />

Er, it's doing _something_, but the text is still clearly changing size throughout the animation.

### The Correct Scale Timing

The problem here lies in this assumption:

> As long as the timing of the scale correction is the same as the parent animation, this approach should work.

In reality, the "correct" inverse scale does not change in the same manner as the parent animation. Instead it kinda does its own thing:

<InverseScaleGraph />

In the example above, the blue line shows the scale of the parent, while the yellow line shows the scale of the child. Notice that the blue line is a straight line whereas the yellow line is a bit of a curve. This tells us that the timing of the inverse scale is not the same as the parent scale!

To fix this, we can either:

1. Calculate the correct timing ahead of time, or;
2. Calculate the inverse scale every time the parent scale changes.

(2) happens to be drastically simpler than (1), and also allows us to handle all sorts of different timings on the parent. This also happens to be the approach that Framer Motion uses.

```ts
animate({
  from: inverseTransform,
  to: {
    x: 0,
    y: 0,
    scaleX: 1,
    scaleY: 1,
  },
  onUpdate: ({ x, y, scaleX, scaleY }) => {
    parentRef.style.transform = `...`;

    const inverseScaleX = 1 / scaleX;
    const inverseScaleY = 1 / scaleY;
    childRef.style.transform = `scaleX(${inverseScaleX}) scaleY(${inverseScaleY}) ...`;
  },
});
```

<InverseScaleSandbox />

### That's Not How it Really Works, Right?

The way that I made the scale correction work in this case is by wrapping the child element in a `<div>` and applying the scale correction to the `<div>`. This implies a few things:

1. There are two elements in the DOM for one Motion component, which may be problematic from a UX perspective;
2. All child components are scale corrected — there's no way for one child to be corrected and another not;
3. There _may_ be issues if the child component is also animating — I haven't tested this, but I assume the scale correction will cause issues because we're distorting the child's coordinate space.

Framer Motion does things a bit differently; you have to _opt in_ to scale correction by making your child component a layout component:

```tsx
<motion.article layout>
  <motion.h1 layout>Hello!</motion.h1> <-- is scale corrected
  <p>World!</p> <-- is not scale corrected
</motion.article>
```

This API implies that the child component needs to be able to "hook in" to the parent's animation, which makes the implementation a tad more complex.

I opted to not implement things this way because I didn't want to take away from the core scale correction concept. If you're interested though, [this part of the Framer Motion source code](https://github.com/framer/motion/blob/main/packages/framer-motion/src/projection/node/create-projection-node.ts) seems to be a good place to start — it looks like they maintain their own DOM-like tree of motion components using something called "projection nodes".

## Summary

Framer motion's magical layout animations are powered by the FLIP technique — a clever way to implement performant layout animations. While implementing FLIP with position changes turned out to be pretty straightforward, the same can't be said for changes in size. When we put size into the picture, we have to worry about:

1. How a change in size affects the distance the element travelled;
2. Correcting distortions in child elements caused by transforms in the parent element;

And a whole slew of edge cases that I didn't quite get into in this post, such as:

1. What if a child component is animating during a layout change?
2. What if the element is inside a scrollable container?

That's all for today, thanks for reading!
