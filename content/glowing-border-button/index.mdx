import { Button, WithoutMaskAndBlur } from "./components/Button";

I recently came across this tweet by Austin Malerba where he shows a really cool glowing border animation:

The sandbox that he posted was a gold mine for SVG, CSS and Framer Motion tricks, so I set out to understand it in-depth by building my own version.

Here's the result:

<Button />

In this post, I want to go over everything I learned doing so!

## The Trick

Austin used a CSS `mask` and a blur to make it appear as if the border is moving and glowing. If we take both of those properties away, the trick reveals itself:

<WithoutMaskAndBlur />

This naturally led to me wondering about two things:

1. How can I make the square move around the border like that?
2. How does a CSS mask work? How are we able to show only the corners of the square?
