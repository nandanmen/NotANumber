# Curves II: Cubic Curves

Quadratic curves are great, but only having one control point can be limiting. For example, you can't really make a nice-looking pill shape using quadratic curves.

On the other hand, cubic curves, the second type of SVG path curve, have **two control points**. This gives you a lot more flexibility in how you can shape your curves.

The syntax is identical to quadratic curves, except you'd need to define two control points instead of 1:

```
C x1 y1, x2 y2, x y
```

Using all of the commands we've looked at so far (cursor, line, and quadratic curve), trace over this little picture frame icon:
