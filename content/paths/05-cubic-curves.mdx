# Curves II: Cubic Curves

Quadratic curves are great, but only having one control point can be limiting. For example, you can't really make a nice-looking pill shape using quadratic curves.

On the other hand, cubic curves, the second type of SVG path curve, have **two control points**. This gives you a lot more flexibility in how you can shape your curves.

Two control points mean you can bend your curve in two different directions. Like maybe to make a little trophy?

## Syntax

Making a cubic bezier curve is very similar to making a quadratic curve, but with the addition of one extra control point (which means an extra pair of `x`â€”`y` coordinates):

```
C x1 y1, x2 y2, x y
```

Like all the other commands, you can use the lowercase `c` to make all the coordinates relative to the cursor.

```
c dx1 dy1, dx2 dy2, dx dy
```

## Practice

Using _both_ curve commands and the other commands we've seen, trace over this rainy cloud:
