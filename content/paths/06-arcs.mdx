# Arcs

The arc, or `A` command, is the last of the SVG path commands we'll be looking at and, in my opinion, the least intuitive to use.

The syntax looks like this:

```
A rx ry x-axis-rotation large-arc-flag sweep-flag x y
```

It's certainly not easy to grasp, so let's start from the beginning.

## How Arcs Are Formed

**An arc is a portion of an ellipse.**

You use the `rx` and `ry` values to control the ellipse's size, and the `x` and `y` values to control where the arc ends on the canvas.

The arc command works by taking the following values:

1. The initial cursor position;
2. The `rx` and `ry` values;
3. The `x` and `y` values;

And then finding an ellipse that "matches" the given values — that is, an ellipse with both of the arc's points on its circumference and with radius `rx` and `ry`.

**Try changing the radius of the arc or the endpoint in the sandbox**. Notice that the ellipse will change to always fit the two points and the provided radii.

What happens when there _isn't_ a match?

We can make that happen by making the diameter smaller than the distance between the arc's points. **Try reducing the `rx` value to anything less than ten** and see what happens.

Notice that when the ellipse isn't big enough to fit the arc's points, the arc isn't affected — it still follows the ellipse's curve. This suggests that the ellipse is implicitly _scaled_ to fit the arc!

## X-Axis Rotation

Let's look at the next argument, `x-axis-rotation`. As you might expect, this value rotates the ellipse around its x (or horizontal) axis.

## Practice

Using _both_ curve commands and the other commands we've seen, trace over this rainy cloud:
