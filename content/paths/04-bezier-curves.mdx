# Curves I: Bezier Curves

Great work!

Now let's talk about curve commands. Curve commands are a tad more complex to wrap your head around, but if you can master them, you can make some _really_ cool shapes with SVG paths.

We'll divide our conversation on curves into two parts — **bezier curves** and **arcs**. We'll start with bezier curves.

## Bezier Curves

A bezier curve is made from a series of points — a start point, an endpoint, and a series of control points in between.

The start and end points determine where the curve will start and end, respectively, while the control points determine the overall shape of the curve.

**Try moving the control points in the playground and notice how the curve changes.**

SVG paths support two types of bezier curves — quadratic and cubic.

### Quadratic Curves

A quadratic curve is a bezier curve with a **single control point**. Its syntax looks like this:

```
Q controlX controlY endX endY
```

This curve, for example, creates a rounded corner:

```
M 5 5
v 5
Q 5 15 10 15
h 5
```

## Practice

Using all of the commands we've looked at so far (cursor, line, and quadratic curve), trace over this little picture frame icon:

(As a little bonus, try rounding the frame!)
