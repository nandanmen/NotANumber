# Path Commands

SVG paths are constructed of a series of commands:

```
M 20 20
v 20
m 30 0
v -20
M 10 50
Q 40 70 65 50
```

Each command starts with an **identifier** that specifies the type of the command, followed by a **sequence of numbers**, which represents the arguments passed to the command.

Commands are split into three different types:

1. **Cursor commands**

```
M 20 20
m 30 0
M 10 50
```

2. **Line commands**

```
v 20
v -20
```

3. **Curve commands**

```
Q 40 70 65 50
```

There are many more commands than the ones you see here. Let's take a look at them, shall we?
