# Cursors

All SVG paths revolve around the **cursor**. As commands are executed, the cursor moves around the canvas, drawing a path behind it.

The cursor always starts at the origin `(0, 0)`, the top left corner. The `M`, or **move**, command lets you move the cursor to a new position without drawing a path:

```
M 10 20
```

The lowercase `m` command does something similar, except it uses **relative** coordinates instead:

```
M 10 20
m 5 5
```

## Practice

**Move the cursor to the points shown on the canvas**.
