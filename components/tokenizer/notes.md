# Notes

Remaining todos:

- [x] Add "known keywords" to the token visualizer
- [x] Make the visualizer more mobile friendly by making the grid mobile-responsive
  - i.e. reduce the grid to 2 cols on mobile, 3 on >md
- [x] Change the example in the "identifier" section to `console.log`
- [x] Add a label to the identifier section to show the current state (i.e. identifier, not an identifier)
- [x] add string literal visualization
  - should i also add the error state? maybe not?
